This project aims to extract contours from raster images of orienteering maps with a pix2pix GAN approach.
The project modifies a pytorch implementation of pix2pix found here: https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
The project is a work in progress, with data generation and modeling currently implemented
